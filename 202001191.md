**Q1**<br />

**Functional Requirement** <br />
**⦁	Any person who wants to use LIS facility , he/she should have to register on the Library Information system using username  and password.**<br />
**⦁	A person who had successfully registred shoud have to login during library hours.** <br />
**⦁	Any member or non member of LIS can search a book on LIS using author name, title of the book or publisher’s name.**<br />
**⦁	Given that the book is currently on hand at the library and is not being issued by another member, any LIS member should be able to issue it.**<br />
**⦁	The system should have to handle all the record  of  the which have already issued , and also remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.**<br />
**⦁	The system should have to take deadline upto 15 days for particular book which has been issued , and User should have to return the book after 15 days. After
     successful return of a book, the user account is updated to reflect the same.**<br />
**⦁	The system also gives members the option to extend their borrowing period if there are no other issues with the book they are currently reading.**<br />
**⦁	Any member who has issued a book might find that his requirement is not over by 15 days. In that case, he might choose to reissue the book, and get the permission      to keep it for another 15 days. A member is only allow to re-issue the book only twice.**<br />

**Non -Functional Requirement**<br />

**⦁ The system should be created using the recent HTML 5.**<br />
**⦁ Only the institute LAN should have access to this system.** <br />
**⦁ The system must be capable of handling at least 100 to 150 users.**<br />
**⦁ This system search option and reissuing should be available 24 hours . However, options like issuing the book and returning the book should be available only            during LIS hours.**<br />
**⦁ The system ought to be secured to prevent anyone from viewing any additional data or passwords.**<br />

**Q2**<br />

**Feature**  <br />

**⦁ The software allows users to monitor their hearing health over time and can be connected to decision-support tools to motivate them to take action in the face of 
     hearing loss.** <br />
**⦁ The approach is used considered on the distension vibration that notifies the user of incoming messages or calls in their mobile.** <br />
**⦁ Knowing that sign language is used as a communication tool for the deaf, technology should help those who are unable to understand sign language by translating it
    into a form that can be easily understood. If a suitable medium of communication, such as a mobile phone, is available, this will make it easier for them to           interact with others. This will assist in removing obstacles encountered when hearing-impaired people communicate with hearing people.** <br />
**⦁ The application should have to notify when the emergency occurs.** <br />
**⦁ Since users are likely to hear, audio is thought to be of less importance, however including audio may be advantageous if the programme is intended to facilitate
    communication between hearing-impaired and sighted persons.** <br />
**⦁ There are four primary criteria that are typically employed when developing mobile applications: 1) Consistent; 2) Offline and Online Operations; and 3) Continuity
    of connectivity 4) Support for several platforms 5) Enhanced performance and power usage.** <br />

**SCOPE** <br />
**⦁ This application should be used in a variety of fields, including education, gaming, communication, and religion.** <br />
**⦁ Since the hearing-impaired cannot hear the sound coming from their phones, the vibration feature in mobile apps could readily inform them. Other applications for       the vibration mode included lesser, higher, and pattern mode. This vibration mode can be altered depending on the severity of the user's hearing loss issue.** <br />

**Non-functional apects** <br />
**⦁	consistency** <br />
**⦁	Accessibility** <br />
**⦁	Advanced sensors** <br />
**⦁	Continuous Connection** <br />
